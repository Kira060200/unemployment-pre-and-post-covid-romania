# unemployment-pre-and-post-covid-romania
Simple yet interesting task to practice my data visualization skills. The resulting graph is 'someri.png'.

**Conclusions from the graph:**
• The number of unemployed workers in Romania increased very little from the first registration of a COVID-19 case until the lifting of the restrictions in May.  Unfortunately, our government does not provide much data on past years to see a trend in unemployment, unlike other EU countries.
• Unemployment decreases in the counties did not exceed 50 people, so I did not put them on the chart, because they are not significant and they were visually tiring.

The data used is freely available at https://data.gov.ro/dataset in csv format, although it requires some cleaning in order to be easily processed
