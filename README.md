# Unemployment pre and post COVID-19 lockdown in Romania
Simple yet interesting task to practice my data visualization skills. The resulting chart is 'someri.png'.

The used data is from the first registration of a COVID-19 case in Romania until the lifting of the restrictions in May 2020.

For non-english speakers, the data is distributed by counties as follows: 

• blue -> unemployment in May(after lockdown)

• orange -> unemployment before the first registration of a COVID-19 case in Romania and the declaration of global pandemic
### Conclusions from the chart:

• The number of unemployed workers in Romania increased very little from the first registration of a COVID-19 case until the lifting of the restrictions in May.  Unfortunately, our government does not provide much data on past years to see a trend in unemployment, unlike other EU countries.

• Unemployment decreases in the counties did not exceed 50 people, so I did not put them on the chart, because they are not significant and they were visually tiring.

### Source:
The data used is freely available at https://data.gov.ro/dataset in csv format, although it requires some cleaning in order to be easily processed.
